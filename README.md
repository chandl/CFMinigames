# CFMinigames
A Simple Minigame Plugin for Minecraft with a Built-In Race Mode.
Originally built for a server called Creative Freebuild.


Includes a built-in minigame called the Elytra Race, where players fly through checkpoints and compete to be the first to cross the finish line.
Races can be dynamically created in-game by moderators inside of existing maps through in-game commands.

This project was built in an object-oriented way, so it shouldn't be too difficult to create new minigame scripts.

I will create more documentation if requested.
Feel free to try this plugin out and contribute more minigames if you find it useful.
